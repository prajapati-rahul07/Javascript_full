// There are two kinds of memory prsent in javascript one is Stack Memory and other is Heap Memory

// all the primitives will get memory allocation in stack area and the copy whatever we perform operations on these then   actually a copy of the variable will be provided

// and all the non-primitives will get memory in heap area here the operations will be performed directly on the reference so any change will be affected directly on the variable
